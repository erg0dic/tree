## A Huffman encoder-decoder based on an AVL tree

**Caution**: The code is not optimized and is purely the outcome of an educational endeavour. 

Things that can be added to make this more challenging if I have time: 

- [] Approximate count statistics to compute huffman frequencies
- [] Optimize for memory efficieny properly?
- [] Benchmark against standard techniques
- [] ...

### Instructions for usage:
Copy-pasta the following command string in the terminal:

````cpp
g++ -O3 main.cpp -o save_out
````
